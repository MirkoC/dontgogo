They say three times the charm, so here is another free responsive Jekyll blog theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing my first two themes [on Github](http://github.com/mmistakes), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. 

If you've used any of [my other themes](http://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) most of this should be familiar territory...

## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index `_layouts`. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Gracefully degrads in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  
* Modern and minimal design.
* Sweet animated menu.
* Background image support.
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Built-in support for Sass courtesy of Jekyll 2.x.
* Optional [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Simple [custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting]({{ site.url }}/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
