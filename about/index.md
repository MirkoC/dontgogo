Hi,

my name is Mirko, I’m a 26 y.o. web developer from Zagreb. I graduated at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb. My primary study was biomedical technologies and informatics.

During my time at the university I started to work in ASP .Net technologies. Later, after graduation,
I’ve had some experience with Java for GUI (Swing) and continued to work in ASP.Net for almost a year.
Now my primary programming stack of interest is Ruby on Rails. I’ve been developing in Rails for almost six months now.
My goal is to become an expert developer in web technologies. I’m a communicative person with healthy work habits.
