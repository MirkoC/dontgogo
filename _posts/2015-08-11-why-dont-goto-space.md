## goto

This is actually my first blog and first blog post. In this post I want tell a story of how and why I chose this
strange name for my blog, and how and why I decided to write a blog in the first place.

I still remember my first programming steps in elementary school when, in informatics class, we started learning Basic and Pascal.
It was pretty basic programming, with a few inputs and outputs, `while` and `for` loops. Then somebody found the `goto` statement.
The teacher wasn't very happy about it, but all the kids loved it, and all of a sudden everybody forgot about `while` and `for`.
The teacher said that we shouldn't use `goto` but never explained why. It wasn't until college that I found out why it's not
a good practice.


## New office

Recently I started working at a new company. The guys at the company are serious about their work and write their own blogs, so I had
no other option than to start my own. They would sometimes say (and still do) that I'm a noob and that I should start
writing about why I'm a noob and how to stop being a noob (they're not jerks as it sounds, just have their way of
motivating new developers <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>).

In fact, I'm not completely green in software development. I've been doing it for almost two years now, but I was never
that interested in learning and applying best practices in programming. I knew some basic stuff and programmed as best as I knew.
Since my coworkers are pretty serious about their work and know a lot about programming and building good software,
now they are encouraging me to do the same.

Through my struggles of writing a great and professional code I'll try to
document everything new I learn and what I feel most of the new (or fairly new) developers don't know or don't understand,
and publish it here on my blog.

For now, I just have one suggestion (it's a good practice in almost all cases): "Don't `goto`"! So, I hope that you now
understand why I named my blog the way I did. The domain ".space" is here just cos it sounds cool <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.





Stay tuned for my first technical blog post, I hope it will come soon.
